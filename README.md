Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Peer Review Assignment

Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository contains the R script, run_analysis.R, as well as other documents needed to complete the John Hopkins Data Science Specialization 
course-Getting and Cleaning Data peer-reviewed assignment for Week 4 of the course.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data 
that can be used for later analysis. 

The object is to create an R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity 
and each subject.

There will be a CodeBook.md that that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data and contains information data to 
indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units,and any other relevant information.
